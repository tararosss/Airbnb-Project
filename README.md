# Airbnb Rentals in Santa Clara County
I used Python to wrangle and analyze a dataset from Inside Airbnb. I then created a report that communicates my analysis process, results and recommendations.

## Objective
To build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

## Key Questions
-  What is the average price of listings in different neighborhoods in Santa Clara County?
- How do ratings and reviews impact the booking frequency and price of listings?
- Which neighborhoods in Santa Clara County have the highest number of Airbnb listings? 

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:

- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathimatical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations
